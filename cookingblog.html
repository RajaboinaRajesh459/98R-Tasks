    <figcaption>Goat meat is very common in Asia, India, the Middle East, South America, Africa, and the Mediterranean. Moreover, goat meat is easier to digest and has more nutrients than other red meats.

        Goat meat is also called mutton (just as pig meat is called pork), and it’s an integral part of several cuisines around the globe. The meat itself is very tender and is often featured in spicy dishes</figcaption>

        Meat – Next, add the tomato paste and coconut milk, followed by the goat meat (mutton), lemon juice, and water.
        Pro tip – The mixture looks a bit thick but the meat will release a lot of juices as it cooks.

        Slow cook – You can cook on low for 6 to 8 hours or on high for 4 to 5 hours until the meat is fork-tender and falling off the bones.
        Pro tip – I like to cook overnight so the meat has time to marinate and absorb all the flavors.
        Garnish – When done, taste and adjust the seasoning and garnish with chopped cilantro.
        Pro tip – Stir carefully because the meat should be fork-tender and can fall apart.

    <h4>Stovetop goat curry</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>In a Dutch oven or heavy bottom skillet, add the oil or ghee, and whole spices.</li>
        <li>If possible, use a Dutch oven as it retains heat evenly and will cook without losing too much liquid. Otherwise, you can also use a heavy bottom skillet with a tight lid.</li>
        <li>Then, add onions and saute until caramelized, almost brown – about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Next, add the ginger and garlic – saute for another minute. Add the mutton or goat meat pieces, and saute for 2 to 3 minutes until the meat is no longer pink.</li>
        <li> Then, add the ground spices and tomato paste. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes until fragrant. Next, add the coconut milk. Combine it and then add ½ cup of water. Season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil on medium heat.</li>
        <li> Continue to simmer it on the stovetop on medium-low heat stirring frequently until the meat is cooked through and becomes fork-tender – about 1 to 1 ½ hour, adding water if necessary.</li>
    </ul>
